So, Kodevember came to halt the week of Thanksgiving. I spent that week preparing for my trip to DC for my aunt's funeral the following week. I was also trying to figure out the scheduling for that week, since I was already scheduled to be in Mexico at the end of that week (Thur-Sun). And I had things scheduled for the 1st 1/2 of the the week after Thanksgiving, which would have to be moved. So, my week after Thanksgiving looked like this:

-  2018-11-25: Fly to DC (Sunday)
-  2018-11-26: Funeral, then up until 5am talking to family
-  2018-11-27: Fly back to Houston 
-  2018-11-28: Wednesday is always my busiest day of the week, now combined w/ some rescheduled stuff.
-  2018-11-29: Fly to Mexico City
    -  Have a bad flight experience on both ends
    -  Realize I have a fever when I arrive, probably from an allergy-based sinus infection that's attempting to take over.
-  2018-11-30: Wake up w/ lessened fever, fly to Guadalajara. Fever is gone by the time I get there. Still feel like crap.
-  2018-12-01: Speak at [PythonDayMX](http://pythonday.mx/)
-  2018-12-02: Fly back to Houston
    +  Arrive at airport 2 hours early for my 9:50 flight, since I can't check in online.
    +  After getting my boarding passes and going to the gate, I find out my first of two flights is canceled
    +  The airline says they "don't have any more planes" so I won't be able to make my connecting flight in Mexico City. They don't expect to have any flights until tomorrow
    +  Having had enough of this airline (looking at YOU InterJet), I buy a one-way direct flight to Houston on United that leaves at 13:30 I'm on that flight as I'm typing this.

For those keeping score at home, that's 5 days of flights over 8 days. The other 3 days were Funeral, Conference Talk, "Busy Day at Home".  As I was trying to work the various scheduling points out, I KNEW I'd be busy. I did NOT plan on being sick for 1/2 of the week.

## UPDATE
I got home yesterday, took a shower and a nap. Then I woke up, went and got dinner, and went BACK to bed. I'm about to do the same now. We'll see what I do about coding in December. There's always something to overcome.
