I picked April for another 30 Day Github challenge. I want to spend more time coding and blogging. I've also got some things going on that are going to require more writing/blogging on my behalf, so now's a great time.

## Rules
-  I'll push code or a blog post (my blog is hosted on Github pages) every day for the month of April.
-  That's it.

I try to keep things simple.

But now, I'm getting an error when I try to run my Jekyll site locally. Which means I can't really PREVIEW these posts. So, THAT'S a thing I'll have to deal with. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Update
Figured out THAT issue (running `bundle exec jekyll serve` from the wrong directory), but NOW this newest page isn't showing up locally.
