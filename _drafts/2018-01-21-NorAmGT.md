## What is NorAmGT?
NorAmGT is the North American Grand Tour. It's something I conceived before I joined the DEFNA board to help improve connections among the North American Django and Python community. 

## Why?
The initial impetus was driven by the fact that the "NA" in DEFNA stands for North America. So, I wanted to help increase the involvement of North American Djangonauts and Pythonistas who were NOT in the US.
