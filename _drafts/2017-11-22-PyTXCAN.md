This year I won't be able to make it to PyConCA. So, I'll be following it online, FROM Texas. This will also allow us to continue the long (?!?) tradition of PyTexasCanada. What's that? You say you haven't heard of PyTexasCanada? Well! Let's look at the history of this venerable institution!

## Year 1
In 2017, I initiated PyTexasCanada (PyTexas at PyCon Canada), largely due to a scheduling coincidence.  You may have seen this [retroactive announcement](https://twitter.com/Transition/status/932368191396999169). If you did, you know this blog post isn't really "soon" after that tweet. My bad.
