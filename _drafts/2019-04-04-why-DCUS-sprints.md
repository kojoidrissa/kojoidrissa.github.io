There are lots of people who can only attend a conference if they have support from their company. That means they either need their company to pay for the travel & lodging or they need to get authorized time off. With that in mind, now that [DjangoCon US 2019 tickets are available](https://2019.djangocon.us/), it's time to start thinking about how long you're going to attend.
